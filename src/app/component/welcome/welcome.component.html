                This research project explores how users would interact with software using other interaction means than
                the mouse and keyboard. In this study, we examine how users would perform common tasks in a spreadsheet
                application by drawing with digital ink on a touchscreen.

                This app will show you several screenshots of spreadsheets and ask you how you would perform a series of
                operations in that simulated application. Please use the pen to draw your commands on the screen, and
                feel free to talk about your thoughts as you do so. The experiment will take about 30 minutes. In this
                study, we will collect the following data: A screen recording and digital ink of your pen strokes on the
                screen; an audio recording of your comments and conversations during the experiment; user experience
                feedback and demographic data.

                All data collected during the experiment will be anonymized (i.e. associated with a neutral
                identification number), so it is not traceable to you or your organization. Parts of the anonymized data
                (excluding audio) may be published in individual or aggregate form.
